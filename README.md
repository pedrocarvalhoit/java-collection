# Java Collection

This repository contains a set of examples on how to use the Java collections. Collections are one of the most important parts of the Java standard library and are widely used in projects of all types and sizes.

Java collections are a set of interfaces and classes that implement various data structures, such as lists, sets, and maps. Each type of collection has its own characteristics and specific methods that can be used to manipulate data.

The examples contained in this repository include:

- ArrayList: examples of how to create, add, and remove elements from an array-based list.
- LinkedList: examples of how to create, add, and remove elements from a linked list-based list.
- HashSet: examples of how to create and manipulate sets with no defined order.
- TreeSet: examples of how to create and manipulate sets with natural or programmer-defined ordering.
- HashMap: examples of how to create and manipulate maps with no defined order.
- TreeMap: examples of how to create and manipulate maps with natural or programmer-defined ordering.
